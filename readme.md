## the-blog

When I graduated college I didn't just leave the academic scene, I largely gave away discource and teaching. I found myself in a daily clock-in clock-out job in which, debate over tools, stacks, or new technologyies were considered a waste of time. Watching YouTube and arguing with my personal tech friends were all I had post college.

During my bachelors I worked as a tutor, was active in hackathons and game jams, and I even presented findings as a research assistant. I was constantly able to share my opinions, and challenge my own ideals. (Something I believe to be required in learning) This blog serves to be my newest idea to share and challenge my thoughts. Many of which you might not agree or care to read. 

Implementation of this website includes a similar voting system to discord, along with anonymous comments to allow free speaking (regarding the topics at hand) to continue the conversation. So if you are interested in tech, programming, general nerd stuff, come check it out at _____(link to come!).

## the-stack

First I started by creating a project with vite, installing a react templ... Wait no. I didnt do that at all. JavaScript is awfully overkill for this kinda of a website. You are telling me you need 10k+ node packages for a blog page... you don't. 

We used **Go**Lang. 

With a backend using the standard `http.NewServeMux()` to host an API and serve our templated html this was fairly straight forward. New external packages, just pure HTML, CSS and Go. Aka the GoCH stack... name in progress... 

## the-deployment

Its vercel... mainly because I expect it not to traffic heavy currently.
